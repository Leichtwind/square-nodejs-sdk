# Change Log

## Version  (2020-12-16T00:00)
## Existing API updates

* **Orders API:** 
  * [OrderLineItemPricingBlocklists.](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItemPricingBlocklists) You can explicitly specify taxes and discounts in an order or automatically apply preconfigured taxes and discounts to an order. In addition, you can now block applying these taxes and discounts to a specific [OrderLineItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItem) in an [order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/Order). You add the `pricing_blocklists` attribute to individual line items and specify the `blocked_discounts` and `blocked_taxes` that you do not want to apply. For more information, see [Apply Taxes and Discounts.](orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts) For example walkthroughs, see [Automatically Apply Discounts](orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts/auto-apply-discounts) and [Automatically Apply Taxes.](orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts/auto-apply-taxes)
  * [OrderPricingOptions](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderPricingOptions). Previously, the `pricing_options` field in an [order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderPricingOptions) supported only `auto_apply_discounts` to enable the automatic application of preconfigured discounts. Now it also supports `auto_apply_taxes` to enable the automatic application of preconfigured taxes. For more information, see [Automatically apply preconfigured catalog taxes or discounts.](orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts#automatically-apply-preconfigured-catalog-taxes-or-discounts)

  * [OrderLineItemTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItemTax). It now includes the new `auto_applied` field. It indicates whether the tax was automatically applied using a preconfigured [CatalogTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/CatalogTax). 


* **Bookings API:**
  * The [CancelBooking](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/bookings-api/cancel-booking) endpoint supports canceling an accepted or pending booking. 
  * The [booking.created](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/webhooks/booking.created) webhook event notifies when a new booking is created by calling the [CreateBooking](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/bookings-api/cancel-booking) endpoint.
  * The [booking.updated](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/webhooks/booking.updated) webhook event notifies when an existing booking is updated.

* **Catalog API:**
  * [ListCatalog](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/list-catalog), [RetrieveCatalogObject](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/retrieve-catalog-object), and [BatchRetrieveCatalogObjects](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/batch-retrieve-catalog-objects) now support the `catalog_version` filter to return catalog objects of the specified version.
  
* **Customers API:**
  * [SearchCustomers](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customers-api/search-customers) endpoint. The `email_address`, `group_ids`, `phone_number`, and `reference_id` query filters are now generally available (GA).
  * The [Customer Groups](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customer-groups-api) API is now GA.
  * The [Customer Segments](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customer-segments-api) API is now GA.


* **Invoices API:** (beta)
  * [Invoice](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/Invoice) object. Added the  `custom_fields` field, which contains up to two customer-facing, seller-defined fields to display on the invoice. For more information, see [Custom fields.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#custom-fields)  
    As part of this change, the following objects are added: 
      * [InvoiceCustomField](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/InvoiceCustomField) object
      * [InvoiceCustomFieldPlacement](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/InvoiceCustomFieldPlacement) enum
  * [InvoiceRequestMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/InvoiceRequestMethod) enum. Added the read-only CHARGE_BANK_ON_FILE value, which represents a bank transfer automatic payment method for a recurring invoice.


* **Loyalty API:** (beta)
  * [LoyaltyProgramRewardTier](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/LoyaltyProgramRewardTier) object. The `definition` field in this type is deprecated and replaced by the new `pricing_rule_reference` field. You can use `pricing_rule_reference` fields to retrieve catalog objects that define the discount details for the reward tier. For more information, see [Get discount details for a reward tier.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/overview#get-discount-details-for-a-reward-tier)  
    As part of this change, the following APIs are deprecated:
