# Change Log

## Version 8.1.1 (2021-01-27T00:00)
## SDKs
* Fixed Node.js test `testCreateInvoice`. Uses `Invoice.delivery_method` instead of deprecated field `InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method`

## Version 8.1.0 (2021-01-21T00:00)
## Existing API updates

* **Invoices API:** (beta)

  The `InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method` field is deprecated, and its current options are separated into two new fields that better represent their scope: 
  * `Invoice.delivery_method` specifies how Square should send invoices, reminders, and receipts to the customer. 
  * `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` specifies the payment method for an automatic payment.

  As part of this change, the [InvoiceDeliveryMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceDeliveryMethod) and [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/enums/InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource) enums are added and the `InvoiceRequestMethod` enum is deprecated.

  The Invoices API will continue to accept `request_method`Â in create and update requests until the field is retired, but starting in this version, `request_method` is not included in returned `Invoice` objects. For more information, see the [migration notes.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#migrate-InvoicePaymentRequest.request_method)
  

* **Locations API:**
  * The [Locations.MCC](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2021-01-21/objects/Location#definition__property-mcc) field is now updatable (beta). You can use the `UpdateLocation` endpoint to update the merchant category code (MCC) associated with a seller location. For more information, see [Initialize a merchant category code.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#initialize-a-merchant-category-code)




## SDKs
* **Connect Node.js SDK:** (deprecated) 

  The deprecated Connect Node.js SDK is in the security [maintenance state.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/api-lifecycle#maintenance) It will not receive any bug fixes or API updates from the Square version 2021-01-21 release. However, the SDK will receive support and security patches until it is retired (EOL) in Q2, 2021. For more information, including steps for migrating to the [Square Node.js SDK,](https://github.com/square/square-nodejs-sdk) see the [Connect SDK README.](https://github.com/square/connect-nodejs-sdk/blob/master/README.md)
  
## Documentation updates
* **Catalog API:**
  * The [Use Item Options to Manage Item Variations](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/item-options-migration) topic is added. It demonstrates how item variations are usually used and how item options can be used to enable random access to item variations.

* **Inventory API:**
  * The [Inventory API](inventory-api/what-it-does) content is updated. It provides clearer guidance about how to use the API, with a task-oriented TOC and improved code examples.



## Version 8.0.0 (2020-12-16T00:00)
## Existing API updates

* **Orders API:** 
  * [OrderLineItemPricingBlocklists.](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItemPricingBlocklists) You can explicitly specify taxes and discounts in an order or automatically apply preconfigured taxes and discounts to an order. In addition, you can now block applying these taxes and discounts to a specific [OrderLineItem](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItem) in an [order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/Order). You add the `pricing_blocklists` attribute to individual line items and specify the `blocked_discounts` and `blocked_taxes` that you do not want to apply. For more information, see [Apply Taxes and Discounts.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts) For example walkthroughs, see [Automatically Apply Discounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts/auto-apply-discounts) and [Automatically Apply Taxes.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts/auto-apply-taxes)
  * [OrderPricingOptions](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderPricingOptions). Previously, the `pricing_options` field in an [order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderPricingOptions) supported only `auto_apply_discounts` to enable the automatic application of preconfigured discounts. Now it also supports `auto_apply_taxes` to enable the automatic application of preconfigured taxes. For more information, see [Automatically apply preconfigured catalog taxes or discounts.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts#automatically-apply-preconfigured-catalog-taxes-or-discounts)

  * [OrderLineItemTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/OrderLineItemTax). It now includes the new `auto_applied` field. It indicates whether the tax was automatically applied using a preconfigured [CatalogTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/CatalogTax). 


* **Bookings API:**
  * The [CancelBooking](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/bookings-api/cancel-booking) endpoint supports canceling an accepted or pending booking. 
  * The [booking.created](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/webhooks/booking.created) webhook event notifies when a new booking is created by calling the [CreateBooking](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/bookings-api/cancel-booking) endpoint.
  * The [booking.updated](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/webhooks/booking.updated) webhook event notifies when an existing booking is updated.

* **Catalog API:**
  * [ListCatalog](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/list-catalog), [RetrieveCatalogObject](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/retrieve-catalog-object), and [BatchRetrieveCatalogObjects](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/catalog-api/batch-retrieve-catalog-objects) now support the `catalog_version` filter to return catalog objects of the specified version.
  
* **Customers API:**
  * [SearchCustomers](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customers-api/search-customers) endpoint. The `email_address`, `group_ids`, `phone_number`, and `reference_id` query filters are now generally available (GA).
  * The [Customer Groups](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customer-groups-api) API is now GA.
  * The [Customer Segments](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/customer-segments-api) API is now GA.


* **Invoices API:** (beta)
  * [Invoice](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/Invoice) object. Added the  `custom_fields` field, which contains up to two customer-facing, seller-defined fields to display on the invoice. For more information, see [Custom fields.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/invoices-api/overview#custom-fields)  
    As part of this change, the following objects are added: 
      * [InvoiceCustomField](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/InvoiceCustomField) object
      * [InvoiceCustomFieldPlacement](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/InvoiceCustomFieldPlacement) enum
  * [InvoiceRequestMethod](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/InvoiceRequestMethod) enum. Added the read-only CHARGE_BANK_ON_FILE value, which represents a bank transfer automatic payment method for a recurring invoice.


* **Loyalty API:** (beta)
  * [LoyaltyProgramRewardTier](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/LoyaltyProgramRewardTier) object. The `definition` field in this type is deprecated and replaced by the new `pricing_rule_reference` field. You can use `pricing_rule_reference` fields to retrieve catalog objects that define the discount details for the reward tier. For more information, see [Get discount details for a reward tier.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/overview#get-discount-details-for-a-reward-tier)  
    As part of this change, the following APIs are deprecated: 
      * [LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinition](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/objects/LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinition) object
      * [LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinitionScope](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinitionScope) enum 
      * [LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinitionType](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2020_12_16/enums/LoyaltyProgramRewardDefinitionType) enum
